# restTest

Technical backend test to fetch data, sort and calculate total amount. I've used [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#readme) module to fetch data and [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run start
```

To test the app

npm run test
```

## Feedback
I'd love to receive feedback on where I could have improved or done things in a different manner.
